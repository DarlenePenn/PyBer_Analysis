# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of the analysis was to create a DataFrame that summarizes the ride-sharing data of PyBer by city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). Then visualize the outcome with a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This allows us to see the sum of weekly fares over time for each city type.

## Results

Rural cities had much lower weekly fares that both Suburban and Urban cities over the course of 4 months.  Suburban cities had more drivers and more rides than Rural cities, resulting in higher weekly fares than the Rural cities, but significantly less than Urban cities, which remained above $1,500 per week from Jan through April of 2019.

The dataset shows that although average fares were higher for Rural cities, there were less drivers and less rides than the other city types.

## Summary
In order to address the disparities amongst city types, I would suggest a concentrated marketing campaign to recruit more drivers in rural areas.  The lack of available drivers likely contributes to the low number of rural rides, which results in less revenue from fares. You could also lower fare prices in rural areas to encourage more customers.  The average fare per driver is more than double that of Urban drivers. 

I would recommend promoting the PyBer service more in Suburban cities. There is an opportunity for growth in these cities since the average share per ride more than Urban rides. If total rides were increased in Suburban areas to meet or exceed that of the Urban rides, the revenue generated could be tremendous.
