# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of the analysis was to create a DataFrame that summarizes the ride-sharing data of PyBer by city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). Then visualize the outcome with a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This allows us to see the sum of weekly fares over time for each city type.

## Results

Rural cities had much lower weekly fares that both Suburban and Urban cities over the course of 4 months.  Suburban cities had more drivers than Rural cities and more rides than Urban cities, resulting in higher weekly fares than the Rural cities, but significantly less than Urban cities, which remained above $1,500 per week from Jan through April of 2019.

## Summary

The dataset shows that although average fares were higher for Rural cities, there were less drivers and less rides than the other city types.
